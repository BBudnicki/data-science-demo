Analysis of the Poudre River


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
```


## Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(
    siteNumbers = '06752260',
    parameterCd = '00060',
    startDate = '2017-01-01',
    endDate = '2022-01-01'
  ) %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



## Assignment. 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


- [x] 1. Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub


- [x] 2. Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo.

- [x] 3. Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

- [x] 4. Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

- [x] 5. Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

- [x] 6. Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

- [x] 7. Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

- [x] 8. **Bonus** Make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

- [X] 9. **Bonus** Create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the`revealjs` package. [Add link to your original report-style document](index_talk.html). 

## DyGraph example. 
```{r}
series <- cbind(points = q_xts)
dygraph(series, main = "Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins (Figure 1)") %>% 
  dySeries("points", label = "7 Day Averae", drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 3) %>%
  dyAnnotation("2018-7-24", text = "C", tooltip = "Peak discharge") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2018-7-22", text = "B", tooltip = "Larimer County lifts evacuation orders") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2018-7-21", text = "A", tooltip = "Larimer County officials closed the Poudre River for all uses") %>%
  dyRoller(rollPeriod = 1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```

## Poudre Paragraph
### Cameron Peak Fire
*Burn scars* caused by the [Cameron peak fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Peak_Fire) lead to dangerous discharge within the Poudre River. On July 21st 2021 **(Label A Figure 1)**. Larimer County officials [closed the Poudre River](https://www.larimer.org/poudre-canyon-flooding) for all use and issued evacuation orders, finally reopening on July 22nd **(Label B Figure 1)**. These flood warnings were issued and then lifted before the *peak discharge* from this rainfall event on July 24th **(Label C Figure 1)**.
