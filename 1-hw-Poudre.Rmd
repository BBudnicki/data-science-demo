# Poudre River

The Poudre river goes through northern Colorado through Fort Collins. By graphing the flow rate over time we can spot annual patterns & sever weather events. Discharge data is downloaded by the dataRetrieval R package from the NWIS web service [waterservices.usgs.gov](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/)

## Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition 

```{r PoudreDataAcquisition}

q <- readNWISdv(
    siteNumbers = '06752260',
    parameterCd = '00060',
    startDate = '2017-01-01',
    endDate = '2022-01-01'
  ) %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

```

## Interactive Plot

```{r PoudrePlot, fig.cap = "Discharge in the Poudre River at the Lincoln Bride in Fort Collins, CO"}
series <- cbind(points = q_xts)
dygraph(series, main = "Discharge in the Poudre River") %>% 
  dySeries("points", label = "7 Day Averae", drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 3) %>%
  dyAnnotation("2018-7-24", text = "C", tooltip = "Peak discharge") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2018-7-22", text = "B", tooltip = "Larimer County lifts evacuation orders") %>%
  dyAnnotation("2018-7-21", text = "A", tooltip = "Larimer County officials closed the Poudre River for all uses") %>%
  dyRoller(rollPeriod = 1) %>%
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("2018-07-01", "2018-8-01")) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```

## Cameron Peak Fire

*Burn scars* caused by the [Cameron peak fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Peak_Fire) lead to dangerous discharge within the Poudre River on July 21st 2018 **(Label A \@ref(fig:PoudrePlot))**. Larimer County officials [closed the Poudre River](https://www.larimer.org/poudre-canyon-flooding) for all use and issued evacuation orders, finally reopening on July 22nd **(Label B \@ref(fig:PoudrePlot))**. These flood warnings were issued and then lifted before the *peak discharge* from this rainfall event on July 24th **(Label C \@ref(fig:PoudrePlot))**.
