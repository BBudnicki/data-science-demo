The [Data Science Demo](https://bbudnicki.github.io/data-science-demo/) R Bookdown website is my final project for the Introduction to Data Science Course ESS 580A7. I took this class in the Spring semester of 2022 as part of my candidacy in the Ecosystem Science & Sustainability (**ESS**) PHD program at Colorado State University.
