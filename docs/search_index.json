Larimer County officials closed the Poudre River for all use and issued evacuation orders, finally reopening on July 22nd (Label B 1.1). These flood warnings were issued and then lifted before the peak discharge from this rainfall event on July 24th (Label C 1.1).

By using Google Earth Engine to download remote sensing data, we can look at the impact the wildfire had on vegetation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) 2.1 NDVI over time There was a clear decrease in NDVI from pre to post burn at Site 2. Site 1 also saw a decrease, albeit quite a bit smaller. Figure 2.1: NDVI over time 2.2 Correlation between NDVI &amp; NDMI Exploring the correlation between NDVI &amp; NDMI looking at the summer months we can see that as surface moisture increases, vegetation increases. Site 2 saw a decrease in surface moisture and vegetation following the same ratio between NDVI and NDMI. Figure 2.2: Impact of surface moisture on vegatitation 2.3 Snow and Vegitation Looking at the previous years snow cover, we show little if any influence on vegetation growth the following summer. Both for the Site 1 &amp; Site 2 pre burn. There is a clear shift in vegetation due to the impacts of burned areas 2.3 from site 2 pre burn to site 2 post burn. The snow cover had lower maximums during this time. This could be due to darker surfaces but also could be due to outside factors such as warmer winters. Based on the sample size it is difficult to tell from this data. Figure 2.3: Impact of snow cover on vegatative growth 2.4 Greenest Month August is the greenest month based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. This holds true for both unburned &amp; burned sites. Figure 2.4: Vegitation (NDVI) by Month 2.5 Snowiest Month Snow cover was greatest in January &amp; February. Site 1 had greater cover than site 2. This can be used as a proxy for snow fall, but is not a direct measurement as the freeze thaw cycle impacts the cover. Interestingly the snow cover post burn at site 2 was less than pre burn. This might be caused by a number of factors related or not related to the burn as theorized in 2.3.
